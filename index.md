    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><b>Hi!</b> My name is Paweł. I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast. I got into Cyber about 2 years ago, but my journey with computers started when I was young and determined to take apart every single electronic device to see how it was built.<br><br>
        Last year, I finished the Red Team Extended course with <a href="https://hackeru.pl" alt="HackerU">HackerU</a>. After that, I needed a little break to spend time with my family, recharge my batteries, and NOW <b>I'M BACK</b>.</p>
    <p>For now, I'm planning to take the PJPT Certificate and after that, the PNPT from TCM Security.</p>
